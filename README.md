# Madridathon-Timer

A subathon timer with Minesweeper-style RNG — donations multiply the timer by a random number from 1–8, à la CSGO loot crates.

## Features
- OBS-compatible timer overlay
- Customizable loot crate-style donation bonuses
- Twitch + PayPal integration
- Configurable multipliers and probabilities

## Usage
1. Add `index.html` as a **Browser Source** in OBS.
2. Timer starts at 24 hours and counts down.
3. Donations will trigger animated RNG to add time! (WIP)
